% A Sample Thesis for the University of Calgary
% =============================================

% Load the UCalgary Memoir Thesis class. By default (without options),
% this produces a 1-1/2 spaced thesis in 11 point font without running
% heads. Use package options singlespaced or doublespaced for single
% or double line spacing. The default font is LaTeX's Computer
% Modern. Use package options times, palatino, libertine, garamond, or
% utopia for other nice typefaces. (You may need to install the
% relevant packages to get these to work.) Use package option headers
% if you want running heads. Use option fullpage if you want the text
% to occupy all allowable space (1 inch margins all around), or option
% manuscript if you want a page layout suitable for reviewing and
% proof reading. Option manuscript selects 12 pt type, doublespaced,
% approx. 25 lines per page, with approx. 72 characters per line. You
% may want to remove the option for the version you file in the Vault;
% it looks nicer and is a bit more compact. You can also use any
% options that the memoir class recognizes, such as 10pt for 10 point
% font, 11pt for 11 point font, 12pt for 12 point type,
% etc. Documentation of the memoir package can be found at
% https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en

% Using LaTeX? Then you're probably using math, and so you want to use
% the AMS math commands and define some theorem environments! But you
% can take these out or use your own favorite theorem package.

\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm}

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{defn}[thm]{Definition} % please number all of them together!

\usepackage{microtype}% microtype makes everything look better

% We'll need some colored links, so we load xcolor and hyperref. But
% you can take that out if you don't want links at all or are happy
% with the standard garish colored boxes.

\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}

% You can turn off the boxes around links made by hyperref. Then links
% will appear in a different color, and per guidelines, all links must
% be blue or black. For blue links say

\usepackage[colorlinks,allcolors=MidnightBlue]{hyperref} 

% For black links, 
% \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% If you prefer hyperref's boxes around links (which don't print), you
% can also change their color. With boxes around links, you probably
% don't want everything in the table of contents to be a link, so we
% only make the page numbers links.
%
% \usepackage[allbordercolors=Periwinkle,linktocpage]{hyperref}

% The table of contents in your PDF reader's sidebar is just titles by
% default, but it's nice to also have chapter and section numbers for
% easy navigation.

\usepackage[numbered]{bookmark}

% For author-year references, you probably want to use natbib with a
% bibliography style appropriate for your discipline; or check out
% latexbib!

\usepackage[round]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{natbib-oup}

% The blindtext package produces the ``lorem ipsum''
% texts in this sample and can safely be removed.

\usepackage{blindtext}

% Now we put in the information for the thesis title page.

% Full Name

\author{Jane Mary Doe}

% Full Title

\title{An Important Contribution to the Literature}

% Official name of the degree

\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}

% The name of the graduate program (not the department!)

\prog{Graduate Program in Philosophy}

% The month (for the final version: when you file, not when you defended)

\monthname{May}

% The year

\thesisyear{2018}

% Tell hyperref to put author and title into the PDF metadata

\hypersetup{pdfinfo={Title={\thetitle},Author={\theauthor}}}

% If you want memoir to produce endnotes, turn them on here

\makepagenote

% Often you only want to output a single chapter so you can send it to
% your supervisor. Use includeonly and make sure everything you don't
% always want compiled to PDF is include'd from a separate file. For
% instance, to produce a PDF only of chapter 1, endnotes and
% bibliography, say

% \includeonly{chapter1,backmatter}

% To compile only the title page, which you need when submitting your
% thesis, say

% \includeonly{titlepage}
