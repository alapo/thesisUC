A short guide on writing your thesis with RMarkdown

*This is a work in progress*

This guide has the goal of introducing you to a new way of writing your thesis using RMarkdown. This repo stems from my frustration using Microsoft Word. In short RMarkdown with the help of a few tools will allow you to re-run your stats with the proper formatting in a very quick way. 


This is a site I saw which has a quick intro on why you should consider using version control

Before we start there are a few things we need to make this go well.

1. Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
3. Install [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download) 

For using references we have 3 packages we need to install
1. Install Zotero (sorry EndNote users)
2. Install BetterBibTex
3. The citr package (optional)
